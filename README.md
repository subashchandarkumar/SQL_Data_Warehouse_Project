## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

# Project Requirements

## Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective

Develop a modern Data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications

- **Data Sources :** Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality :**  Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope :** Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of the data is not required.
- **Documentation :** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## BI: Analytics and Reporting (Data Analysis)

### Objective
